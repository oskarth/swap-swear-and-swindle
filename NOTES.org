* Misc imported notes

To re-run migrations we use `truffle migrate --reset`.

Ganache GUI is running on 7545.

Mind the gas limit, can be set as command line argument `npx ganache-cli -l
10000000` or in Ganache UI.

The goal is to get end to end cheque sending etc working. This requires:

- ERC20 token
- SimpleSwapFactory
- SimpleSwap

And then some interactive use of these.

To get contract creation code we can fire up a node REPL and do:
`web3.eth.getCode("0x9A370560A64f9Bd7a7BB63CCc41162A52aa33096")`. This will show
contract code and constructor code for SimpleSwapFactory, which is 64
zero-padded address.

Initially tried doing this in nim-waku repo using nim-web3, but ran into issues
with not being able to have constructor take argument. See
https://github.com/status-im/nim-web3/issues/33

Instead, doing it in this repository first to see end to end flow. Doing it with
Ganache for simplicity first. Later on this can use Goerli or similar.
